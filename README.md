# Morgan Msrn's dotfiles

This repository contains various configuration files I use on my machines, software and tools.

## Goals

This repository lets me version control my config files and can also serve as an inspiration for your own. Be advised these files are not meant to be used or copied without overview : they are customized to my needs, and are definitely not one size fits all.

## Contents

- Shell : ZSH (requires oh-my-zsh for the prompt)

## Usage

Check each folder for specific documentation and usage.
