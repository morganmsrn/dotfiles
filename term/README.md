# Morgan's terminal emulator config

I use WezTerm across all my machines, it is incredibly simple to setup and works amazing across all the OSes I use.

Note : I used to use Alacritty, but their MacOS support isn't all that good.

## Usage

The config file needs to be in the home directory.

``` zsh
ln -s [repo]/term/wezterm.lua ~/.wezterm.lua
```
